Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
My first milestone for my main project in creating a DIY air quality monitor involves the physical assembly of the device. I began by gathering all necessary hardware components, including sensors and a microcontroller. The assembly started with soldering headers onto the Feather boards and sensors for secure connections. Next, I wired these components together according to the detailed circuit diagram provided in the guide. Later, I will secure the finished hardware components into a secure box, this step will be done after the software has been coded. I will print this secure box using 3d printing programs. This step is crucial as it ensures the stability and durability of the monitor under various environmental conditions.

HU 054A Calculator
Components Used: 1x Intergraded Circuit, 1x Display, 17x Input Buttons, 1x Capacitor, 1x Circuit Board, 1x Battery, 1x Battery Holder, 1x Diodes
The HU054A operates using a combination of electronic components including an integrated circuit which functions as the brain, processing all calculations. When a button on the keypad is pressed, it sends a signal to the IC, which then processes this input based on pre-programmed instructions to perform arithmetic operations. The results are then displayed on an LCD screen. This entire process is powered by a battery.

Building the HU054A Calculator provides a rich learning experience in understanding electronics assembly and circuit design. Through this project, I enhanced my soldering skills, gained insights into the functions and interactions of various electronic components like resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits. I also learned crucial troubleshooting techniques. These skills are foundational for anyone interested in electronics and can provide a strong base for further exploration and innovation in engineering and technology.

During the assembly of the HU054A Calculator, I encountered several challenges that tested my technical skills and patience. One major issue arose when I incorrectly installed the battery, which initially prevented the device from powering on. Identifying and correcting this error required careful examination and adjustment of the battery placement in its holder. Additionally, installing the integrated circuit presented its own set of difficulties. The circuit had to be precisely aligned with the pin configuration on the circuit board; any misalignment could potentially damage the delicate pins or result in malfunctioning of the calculator. These challenges emphasized the importance of meticulous attention to detail and the need for a steady hand when working with such compact and sensitive electronic components.

As part of my starter project, I devised a plan to assemble the HU054A Calculator, focusing on preparation, assembly, and testing. Initially, I gathered all necessary components and set up a well-organized workspace for efficient assembly. Next, I mounted the resistors, capacitors, and diodes on the printed circuit board, followed by the precise installation of the integrated circuit and the LCD display. The keypad was attached ensuring proper contact with the PCB. After installing the battery, I will conducted initial power tests and functionality checks, testing each key and performing various calculations to verify all operations.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
