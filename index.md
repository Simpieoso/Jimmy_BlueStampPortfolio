The Air Pollution Monitor project, an initiative that marks a significant step forward in the fight against environmental pollution. This project primarly aims to provide accurate and real-time data on air quality, using a sophisticated network of integrated sensors like the feather m4 express, airlift feather wings, bme280, and also allows advanced data analytics using Adafruit IO.

```For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:```
My first milestone for my main project in creating a DIY air quality monitor involves the physical assembly of the device. I began by gathering all necessary hardware components, including sensors and a microcontroller. The assembly started with soldering headers onto the Feather boards and sensors for secure connections. Next, I wired these components together according to the detailed circuit diagram provided in the guide. Later, I will secure the finished hardware components into a secure box, this step will be done after the software has been coded. I will print this secure box using 3d printing programs. This step is crucial as it ensures the stability and durability of the monitor under various environmental conditions.

HU 054A Calculator
Components Used: 1x Intergraded Circuit, 1x Display, 17x Input Buttons, 1x Capacitor, 1x Circuit Board, 1x Battery, 1x Battery Holder, 1x Diodes

The assembly of the HU054A Calculator involves utilizing a variety of electronic components, the core of which is an integrated circuit (IC) that serves as the central processing unit, executing all computational tasks. Upon pressing a button on the keypad, a signal is transmitted to the IC. This component then processes the input in accordance with its pre-set programming, conducting arithmetic operations, the outcomes of which are subsequently exhibited on an LCD screen. This entire operational sequence is energized by a battery.

Embarking on the construction of the HU054A Calculator afforded me an invaluable educational opportunity to delve into the intricacies of electronics assembly and circuit design. Through this endeavor, I honed my soldering techniques, deepened my understanding of the roles and interplay between diverse electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits, and developed essential troubleshooting skills. These competencies form a critical foundation for anyone pursuing a passion in electronics, setting the stage for further exploration and innovation within the fields of engineering and technology.

Throughout the assembly process of the HU054A Calculator, I confronted a series of challenges that rigorously tested both my technical abilities and patience. A significant obstacle emerged when I mistakenly installed the battery, which initially impeded the device from activating. To resolve this issue, I meticulously inspected and adjusted the battery’s placement within its compartment. Additionally, the task of mounting the integrated circuit proved challenging; it required exact alignment with the pin configuration on the circuit board, as any deviation could potentially harm the fragile pins or cause the calculator to function improperly. These hurdles underscored the necessity of acute precision and a steady hand, especially when handling compact and sensitive electronic components.

For my initial project, I crafted a detailed strategy to construct the HU054A Calculator, with particular emphasis on meticulous preparation, assembly, and testing phases. Initially, I assembled all requisite components and arranged a well-structured workspace to streamline the assembly process. Subsequently, I secured the resistors, capacitors, and diodes onto the printed circuit board. This was followed by the careful placement of the integrated circuit and the LCD display. The keypad was then affixed, ensuring optimal contact with the PCB. Upon installing the battery, I conducted preliminary power tests and functionality checks, systematically testing each key and executing various calculations to confirm the calculator’s operational efficacy.

# Schematics

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
