# My Portfolio
My main project is the Air Pollution Monitor. This project provides accurate and real-time data on air quality using a sophisticated network of integrated sensors and complex softwares. It is an initiative that marks a significant step forward to fight against environmental pollution and promote a clearner and healhier Earth. I chose this project because it delves into the statstics of air pollution, this is vital to raising awareness of the polluted air that we breath in. This project also teached me the background of climate change and the effects caused by air polluton. For example, humid air traps pollutants close to the ground and prevents them from dispersing into the atmosphere, this increases the pollutants in the air that we breath and it is extremely harmful to our lungs, this effect is significantly increased in urban areas.

## Summary

For my final milestone, I planned to begin designing my enclosure and also collect data over several days to verify the functionality of my project. Since my last milestone, I've collected roughly 3 days worth of data and at different pleaces. For example, at BSE the AQI quality was good and at home it was moderate. This shows that my project works and also practical to test home air qualities. Secondly, while I waited for the data to collect and upload I began designing my enclosure and modifications. I've gone from a simple single box enclosure designs to a multiboxed and enviromental friendly enclosure that uses recyclable 3d printing material. I intinally planned on a single enclosure with a locking mechanism, however, due to complications with accessing the project and dampness issues that may occure on rainly days. I changed the idea from a single box enclosure to instead use two boxes that interlocks with one another and allows for wiring through the interlocking part. This design took me a long time to come up with but after careful and precise planning, I drew the skeleton of my final blueprint.

## Challenges

As for my challenges, I would like to talk about my challenges on both my start and main project on my final milestone and also the challenges I've faced at BSE. My start project was fairly simple and easy to understand, although most of the project involved soldering and not as much software, I still struggled as it was my first time soldering. The most difficult part of my start project was defitnetly the soldering, not because I wasn't profecient in it but rather becase the soldering iron I was given was defective and took a long time to heat and would not reach high enough temperature to melt the soldering iron. All in all, my starter project wasn't too challenging and intead I think it was a fun and enjoyable experience that helped me ease into my main project. During my main project was where I faced the most trouble and complications, the instructions I was given was unclear and incorrect. Multiple steps in the instructions led me further away from completing the project, I worked with an instructor to debug the software and through many hours of debugging, we found out that there were also hardware issues such as, wiring into incorrect slots and missing wires that the instructions caused. It took a lot of time to finish debugging my project and fixing the code, the hardware was fairly easy but still gave me plenty of trouble. All in all, at BSE I believe that through the help of instructos any challenges can be faced. Im glad that I was able to run into these errors as it gave me a learning opportunity and a better way to connect with other students and instructos at BSE.

# Second Milestone

## Summary
For my second milestone, I planned to finish setting up the software for my project. It didn’t end up going as planned. I faced many obstacles and setbacks. For example,  the instructions I was given were unclear and incorrect and it led to problems with the wiring. I couldn’t connect my air particle sensor to the rest of the hardware due to this and this led me to learn more about each type of pin and I ended up resoldering multiple wires from the incorrect ports to the correct ones. Later I tested the code that was given to me for my project and unfortunately it also ended up being incorrect, the code was outdated and many files that were necessary for the project to function were not provided. To solve this problem, I had to write most of the new code. The original code had roughly 150 lines of code and after debugging and rewriting the code, it ended up at roughly 200 lines of code. With the help of other students that are doing the same project and through the guidance of our instructors we succeeded in debugging and reconstructing the project. In the end all the hardware and software were fixed and the project uploaded data to the website.

## Challenges

I faced many challenges thorughout my second milestone, the instructions I was given was mostly incorrect and difficult to follow. As a result, I had recoded most of the program and reassembled a lot of my wires in order to solve the problem. I learned more about what each pin did in my project and one thing that was important to my project that I learned was the importance of managing voltages and currents. After a deep dive into the projects previously given code, I found out that the given files were also incorrect. There were multiple missing files and some were designed for another project. To help other students with this project in the future, I also helped to rewrite a set of instructions for future indivisuals who may attempt this project.

## Summary
My first milestone for my main project in creating a DIY air quality monitor involves the physical assembly of the device. I began by gathering all necessary hardware components, including sensors and a microcontroller. The assembly started with soldering headers onto the Feather boards and sensors for secure connections. Next, I wired these components together according to the detailed circuit diagram provided in the guide. Later, I will secure the finished hardware components into a secure box, this step will be done after the software has been coded. I will print this secure box using 3d printing programs. This step is crucial as it ensures the stability and durability of the monitor under various environmental conditions.

## Summary
HU 054A Calculator
Components Used: 1x Intergraded Circuit, 1x Display, 17x Input Buttons, 1x Capacitor, 1x Circuit Board, 1x Battery, 1x Battery Holder, 1x Diodes

Before I began building my starter project, I learned how to solder and wire through one of my instructors and I was pretty bad at it at first. After some practice and improvement, I started my project. At first I worked efficently and diligently but around half way done I realized I had soldered some of the wires incorrectly or some soldering was incomplete, this lead me to redo most of my soldering and in general it was a lot of wasted time. After some troubleshooting and helpful tips from the instructors, I was able to fix my issues and proceed onto the software. The code for the calculator was surprisingly simple due to the project being programmed in python which allows for simple arithmetic functions with little to no effort. Not long after setting up the code for my project, I started testing to see if it works as intended. It did not. After careful examination, I noticed the battery being too far away from the battery slot and I had to resolder the slot to fit the battery in. This project gave me plenty of problems and errors; however, that wasn't all of it, I found it enjoyable and entertaining. I felt very motivated when I began working on this project and once I finished it I felt complete and content with what I built.

## Challenges 
Through the construction of my starter project, I learned many crucial lessons and gained invaluable educational experiences. To be able to successfully assemble my project, I honed my soldering techniques, and deepened my understanding of the roles of each electronic components that I will use such as resistors which limit the amount of voltages that go through the circuit, and capacitors that temporarily store electrical energy. Additionally, I developed essential troubleshooting skills to resolve any possible setbacks during my project. These steps formed a critical foundation for me towards the assembly of components in this project.

## Schematics
Throughout the assembly process of the HU054A Calculator, I faced a series of challenges and setbacks that tested my technical abilities and patience. A significant obstacle emerged when I improperly installed the battery. To resolve this issue, I carefully inspected and adjusted the battery’s placement within its compartment. Additionally, mounting the integrated circuit into the protective casing proved challenging; it required careful installation and exact alignments with the pin configuration on the circuit board, as any deviation could potentially break the fragile pins.

Lastly, upon reinstalling the battery, and careful installation of the integrated circuit,  I conducted multiple power tests and functionality checks to ensure that my calculator is working correctly.
